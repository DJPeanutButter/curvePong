CurvePong

Use the arrow keys to move your paddle left and right.

Get more points for moving the ball faster and curving the ball.

On service, you may only hit the ball once with the paddle, you may not hit the walls on service.

At any point, the center will be green if you can drop the ball without losing a point. If the center is red, however, you will lose the volley if you drop the ball.

When posession changes, the paddle is typically reset to the middle of the field. The only exception is when the ball lands in the center of the field, and resetting the paddle would block the ball from bouncing up.

Have fun!
